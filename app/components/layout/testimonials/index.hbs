		<h5 white>"Here at Yaacomm we are already using SurrealDB in a significant way for our backend infrastructure, however I believe SurrealDB can play an even bigger role in other areas as well. Being able to embed SurrealDB locally in Android and iOS apps could make it a perfect fit for local caching. Additionally, this would provide us with all the benefits of SurrealDB such as full-text searching and its graph based nature without relying on a network connection."</h5>
