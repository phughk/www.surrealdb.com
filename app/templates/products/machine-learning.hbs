		<h1>Bring simplified and scalable machine learning model inference to your data.</h1>
		<h5>SurrealML enables machine learning models to be greatly simplified, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in machine learning pipelines. Running on our Rust engine, models can be built in Python, and imported in to SurrealDB for inference within the database runtime.</h5>
