		<h1>SurrealIX</h1>
		<h2>SurrealDB is designed for building applications of any size - and for that, query performance, and improved data analysis workloads are key. With SurrealDB secondary indexes, you can now index data using traditional indexes, full-text search indexing, and vector-embedding search for artificial intelligence use cases.</h2>

The indexing engine is integrated with the SurrealQL query language natively, without the need for an additional external query language, or for indexing-specific functions or plugins" />
