		<h5>"When I first learned about SurrealDB last fall, it looked like an excellent open-source database that did many things in one database. I wanted it to be real!  I sent a pull request to add support for it, followed by an unsolicited design proposal to implement a scalable 'change feeds' feature on top of it. A few months later, I became a full-time SurrealDB employee. Today, I'm one of the SurrealDB maintainers because I want to build a database of my dreams with you."</h5>
