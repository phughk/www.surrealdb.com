#### Bulk insert support in the Rust SDK

This was one of the frequently requested features. While this was already possible using the `query`
method, this release adds an `insert` method that makes it more convenient.

```rust
db.insert(Resource::from("person"))
    .content(vec![
        User {
            id: thing("person:tobie")?,
            name: "Tobie",
            settings: Settings {
                active: true,
                marketing: false,
            },
        },
        User {
            id: thing("person:jaime")?,
            name: "Jaime",
            settings: Settings {
                active: true,
                marketing: true,
            },
        },
    ])
    .await?;
```
